# Replicated.Coms Core Product: KOTS (Kubernetes-off-the-Shelf) | kots.io
KOTS encompasses several open source projects:
* Kots CLI and Kotsadm (installation and admin console)
* Troubleshoot (preflight checks and support bundles)
* kURL (embedded K8s option)

It also interacts with other OSS projects: 
* Kubernetes
* Kustomize
* Helm
* Kubeadm

## That's So Cool...
kurl.sh as a domain name so you can:
```
https://kurl.sh/... | bash
```

## Concepts
* `Release Channels` are logical stacks that you stage and promote to users.
